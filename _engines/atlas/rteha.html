<p>This engine was installed in 1939 at the Duryea Ice Plant in Montauk, New York.  It was in operation up until 1996, when it was uninstalled and a member of the Duryea family donated it to the Rough &amp; Tumble Engineers Historical Association.  It is similar to the engine donated to the <a href="liapa.html">Long Island Antique Power Association</a> from the same source.</p>
