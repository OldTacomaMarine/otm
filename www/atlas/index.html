		<h1>Atlas-Imperial</h1>
		<p>Atlas-Imperial engines were considered one of the most serviceable diesels ever built in the US. Starting in 1916, Atlas built diesels for tugboats, fish boats and coasters. With engines in a variety of sizes (2 to 8 cylinders), their diesels became common on the West coast shore. Many engines that were built in the 1920's continued to run into 1951.  Soon after, Atlas closed its Oakland, California, doors.</p>
