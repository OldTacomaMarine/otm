		<p>This first engine was a single cylinder 8 horsepower, 6 3/4 &quot; bore by 8&quot; stroke, running at 400 rpm.  It weighed 1750 pounds.  Upon completion of this unit a two cylinder, 7 1/2&quot; x 9 1/2&quot; engine was designed developing 20 horsepower and weighing approximately 3200 pounds.  The first two of these 20 horse power engines were put in a barge in San Francisco bay.</p>

		<p>In November 1920, Enterprise announced the first diesel engine, which, incidentally, was also the first diesel engine manufactured in San Francisco, which was a 3 cylinder, 9 1/4&quot; x 14&quot;, developing 80 horsepower at 320 rpm.  One of the unique features of this engine was the Hvid fuel injection system.  This engine was later increased to develop 100 horsepower and the weight of this engine was 20,000 pounds.</p>

		<p>The next important step in the development of Enterprise engines was in 1921 license was obtained to apply the Vickers common rail fuel injection system to the engines.  Concurrently with this development efforts were made to reduce the weight per horsepower and build a more &quot;up to date engine&quot;.</p>

		<p>In 1924 the Enterprise Engine &amp; Foundry Co. merged with the Western Machine Co. of Los Angeles who were already building strictly stationary engines.  This merger brought about the Western Enterprise engine which was developed for both marine and stationary applications by the combined efforts of the two merged companies.</p>
