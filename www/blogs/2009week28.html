		<h1>2009 Week 28 in Review</h1><br>
		<h3>July 6 to July 11, 2009</h3><br><br>

		<p>Early Sunday morning, I picked up all the remaining tools from the <a href="../washington/arthur.html"><i>Arthur Foss</i></a>, put the yacht back in the driveway, cleaned up my desk, and got back on a plane to Quincy, Illinois.</p> 

		<h2>Back to Quincy</h2>

		<p>I went back to the <a href="../fairbanks/indiangrave1.html">Indian Grave Pumphouse</a> despite the bad news that only two sets of piston rings had arrived, so I spent the week setting up the remaining rod bearings as close as I could without the pistons.  I used a spare rod dangled from above to allow me to tighten the rod bearing bolts and get a more accurate bearing running clearance.  Then, I used an old technique Dan told me from a while back: how to set bearing clearances without using dials.  </p>

		<p>I adjust the shims until they're really close, then continue to adjust them one thousandth by one thousandth until the bearing just starts to drag on the journal when I move it side to side.  When it starts to drag, that means it's basically at 0, so I add shims one by one until I get about .004 worth of clearance.  </p>

		<p>I really needed this method because without the piston to center the bearing, it was too squirrelly to bump without a dial.  Once the pistons are installed all the clearances will be set precisely, but I did this initial setup to make the final bump faster. </p>

		<p>I also made some special tools to fit in place of rod bearing shims, allowing the piston height to be easily set, since I accidentally destroyed some valuable shims using a big stack of them to set piston height earlier.  I only got to use the tool two times this trip, but I also got to show it off to the Fabius River Drainage District commissioners and the operator.</p>

		<p>All the roustabouts and pump guys have been working four ten-hour days, so they all get Friday off.  I chose this day to invite the Fabius guys to the Indian Graves Pumphouse to discuss maintaining their Fairbanks-Morse (6)32E14s. The meeting went great!  I had all the tools and Nathan's help to show how easy it is to repair and maintain big heavy-duties like Fairbanks.  As a demonstration, we pulled a rod bearing, looked at it, and then put it back and checked the piston height.  All of them were impressed and Nathan and I felt like we may have saved two amazing engines from the scrapper.</p>

		<h2>Road Trippin'</h2>

		<p>Right after the meeting, I wrapped everything at Indian Graves up to go back to the airport, so that I could get to Seattle and immediately turn around and fly to Alaska to ship out on <a><i>Catalyst</i></a>.  </p>

		<p>Well, things just got ridiculous.  I got a flat tire on the rented Prius.  Damn.  Oh, well.  I put on the spare tire, then made one more trip down to the levy to drop off an engine manual, and then I'll be damned - I got <i>another</i> flat <i>and</i> picked up a nail in a different tire.  </p>

		<p>With the flight leaving in 3-1/2 hours, I was able to look up the closest tire repair shop on my phone.  &quot;Ron's Tire Shop&quot; sent a truck right away.  I reported the incident to the rental company over the phone, and arranged to have someone drop me off immediately once I got to the rental office in the off chance that I got there in time.  Then, I arranged new flights in case I missed this one, and reserved a hotel room across the highway from the airport, and began re-scheduling the flight to Alaska (currently set for 10:30 AM pacific time).</p>

		<p>While on the phone, the tire repair guy was carrying on with the mechanic.  He had to drive back to the shop and get two new tires.  I'll take the time to file a claim later.  Finally, the tires were installed and the one with the nail patched, then I hit the road.  The drive from Quincy to St. Louis (which I'm getting really familiar with) usually takes two hours; this time, I made it in one and a half and made the flight with <i>seconds</i> to spare.  Wow!  Once I got my boarding pass and went through the security check-in, I heard the elevator music movie scene from the <i>Blues Brothers</i> where they are in the elevator after the best car chase ever.  </p>

		<h2>The <i>Ready</i> hauled-out</h2>

		<p>We heard that the tug <a href="../atlas/ready.html"><i>Ready</i></a> was hauled out and looks great.  Sounds like the new owners are making progress - I hope they get the engine running again soon!</p>

		<h2>A new <i>Portolan</i> is out!</h2>

		<p>I just got a newsletter from <a href="http://www.nwseaport.org">Nortwest Seaport</a> with all the non-engine news from the organization.  They included a feature article on the YMTA Engineer for a Day field trip that I ran for them last February.  They've put up a .pdf version on their website if you haven't gotten yours by mail, so <a href="http://www.nwseaport.org/docs/portolan_summer-09.pdf">go check it out</a>.</p>

		<p>It looks like they're doing really good things these days.  I might even renew my membership.</p>
 
		<h2>Hand-fitting versus precision parts</h2>

		<p>Whenever I'm scraping bearings in, I get a lot of grief from spectators who see all my fuss over each engine part and how I seem &quot;overly concerned&quot; about fit and how the method is slow.  Fitting bearings does take a long time, but it's not a process that you can take shortcuts on.  I rarely use power tools on parts that must fit precisely, because the margin for error is just too great.  Scraping in a bearing is a time-consuming process that requires patience and seems to be seen as a dying art.</p>

		<p>New engines use all precision parts that you can just bolt on and go.  This is desirable because labor rates are higher than the cost of parts and parts can now be machined with fairly close tolerances.  The same holds true for a lot of things these days: engines, furniture, trains, buildings, jewelry, or martinis.  Houses can be assembled without using a saw, trains are delivered in a box, and I even drank a mixed drink from a can while I was on the airplane.  However, I know I'm not alone in my belief that finding a mechanic who can hand-fit bearings is like finding a bartender who can make that perfect cocktail the old-fashioned way: it may take longer and it may be more expensive, but it's totally worth it at the end of the day.</p>

		<p>I do regret that the fitting take so much time and believe me when I say there is progress - though it may be hard to see behind the ever-mounding pile of emery bits.  Most of all, be patient!</p>

		<h2>Off to Alaska</h2>

		<p>On Saturday, OTM Inc's lead mechanic took off to Alaska again to work on the <a href="../washington/catalyst.html"><i>Catalyst</i></a> until September.</p>
