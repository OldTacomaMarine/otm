		<h3>January 27 to February 2, 2008</h3><br><br>
				
		<h2>Finishing up the <i>Maris Pearl</i></h2>

		<p>I finished resealing the No 1 oil tube and put the <a href="../enterprise/marispearl.html"><i>Maris Pearl</i></a>'s <a href="../enterprise/index.html">Enterprise</a> back together - kinda at the last minute (sorry Jay!).  The hard part of repairing the oil tubes on the starboard side is that the cam followers are in the way.  I had to remove the push-rods, then wire the cam followers in place, then unbolt and remove the block of three followers and guides removed.  This exposes the oil tube for repair.</p>

		<p>Unlike Atlas-Imperial or Washington Iron Works engines, Enterprises have many of their moving parts inside a casing.  Removing the push rods means removing the cylinder head cover, then pulling the push-rods out from this case.  Here's the exposed cylinder head:</p>

		<p>and here's the push rods laying on top of the other cylinder heads (still covered):</p>

		<p>I had the <i>Maris Pearl</i> all re-assembled by the time Jay needed my help running her out to Lake Union Dry Dock.  More on that later.</p>

		<h2>A Washington-Estep in Kodiak</h2>

		<p>Guy formerly of Alaska emailed OTM Inc with information about two complete <a href="../washington/index.html">Washington Iron Works</a> engines in Kodiak.  One Washington is being restored by the <a href="http://www.kodiakmaritimemuseum.org">Kodiak Maritime Museum</a> in Guy's own garage, while the other and an <a href="../atlas/index.html">Atlas-Imperial</a> are in the old Port Williams cannery on Shuyak Island.</p>

		<p>Here's Guy's description of how he came to have a Washington-Estep in his garage:</p>

		<p><i>Marty Owen, the Harbormaster of Kodiak got a hold of it somehow.  He told me, but I can't remember.  It is from the Salmon Cannery at Uganik and was used to run a line belt for canning.  He had it stored in a City of Kodiak warehouse for about five years when I found it hiding under a blue tarp.  They were getting ready to remodel the building, and he had to get it out of there.  I said he could keep it in my garage, and I would see if I could get it put on a trailer for a running display.  The Kodiak Maritime Historical Society plans to get it mounted on the trailer I found and use it for a running display at the Kodiak King Crab Festival. </i></p>

		<p>From the pictures that Guy sent, it looks like they are well on their way to running this engine soon:</p>

		<p>Guy was able to provide us with this engine's serial number, 7153.  With this number, OTM Inc was able to look up the original manufacturer records of it and confirm Guy's memory that it was shipped in March, 1928 to the San Juan Fish &amp; Packing Company for use as a belt drive.  The San Juan Fish &amp; Packing Company ordered a four-cylinder marine engine on the same day for use in its boat <i>Caroline</i>.  We're posting the information we know about this engine as we discover it on the website; check out what we have so far <a href="../washington/kmm.html">here</a>.</p>
