		<h1>2008 Week 21 in Review</h1><br>
		<h3>May 18 to May 24, 2008</h3><br><br>

		<p>The next morning, we got underway early, bound for Ketchikan.  We passed the <a href="../atlas/songhee.html"><i>Songhee</i></a>, a retired Army tug powered by an Atlas diesel that now operates as a Southeast Alaska charter boat:</p>

		<p>When we pulled into Ketchikan, we had to squeeze the <i>Pearl</i> into a tight marina between two giant cruise boats.  After mooring, we toured all the bars in Ketchikan with Brian and Roger.  It was sunny for once, but there were five cruiseships in port and that made the whole town kind of crazy.  It quieted down after the cruiseships left, and the locals were fun to chat with. </p>

		<p>We spent the next day in K-Town, and took a day trip to <a href="http://www.metlakatla.com/">Metlakatla</a>, a small native village south of Ketchikan. On the way there, we passed this waterfall with an old powerstation at its base:</p>

		<p>I also saw a home overlooking the water with &quot;Leask&quot; carved in the door.  I thought it might be Irv's house, or one of his family member's house (that's Irv from the <a href="../atlas/veleroiv.html"><i>Velero IV</i></a>.  Back in Ketchikan, we toasted Brian and Craig before their departure, and had dinner at <a href="http://www.gilmorehotel.com/annabelles.htm">Annabelle's</a> again. </p>

		<p>On Thursday, I spent all day in the engine room again, cleaning and taking care of small things.  I flew out Friday morning, back to Seattle and &quot;real&quot; work.  The trip was a lot of fun, but I'm definitely glad that the <i>Pearl</i> is done for another season.</p>

		<h2>Reader-Submitted Heavy-Duty Stories</h2>

		<p>I've received several interesting stories from readers in the past few weeks.  </p>

		<p>First, a man from the Netherlands emailed to report a crane-barge powered by a 1944 <a href="../atlas/index.html">Atlas-Imperial</a>.  The crane barge is reportedly run several times a week, showing that the heavy-duties are still doing what they were designed to do.  We posted the full story on the discussion board <a href="http://www.websitetoolbox.com/tool/post/oldtacomamarine/vpost?id=2754026">here</a>.</p>

		<p>Later, fireman Robert from New York emailed about the city's two fireboats powered by <a href="../enterprise/index.html">Enterprise</a> diesels, the <a href="../enterprise/johndmckean.html"><i>John D. McKean</i></a> and the <a href="../enterprise/alfredesmith.html"><i>Alfred E. Smith</i></a>.  We posted Robert's full email on the discussion board <a href="http://www.websitetoolbox.com/tool/post/oldtacomamarine/vpost?id=2754038">here</a>. I'm also making plans to drop by and visit when I'm in New York later this month.  I'll write all about it here when I get back.</p>

		<p>Finally, we received an email and later a phone call from Dirk about his days on the <a href="../washington/arthur.html"><i>Arthur Foss</i></a> in the early 1970s, just after Foss donated the boat to Northwest Seaport.  Dirk was one of the first volunteers to help get the tug running as a heritage vessel.  He was helping with a program called North by Northwest that got city kids out on boats, which ended up using the <i>Arthur</i> for some of their programs (an early maritime heritage partnership!).  </p>

		<p>We posted his full story over at the discussion board <a href="http://www.websitetoolbox.com/tool/post/oldtacomamarine/vpost?id=2753842">here</a>. It's a great read, and shows another piece of heavy-duty history.</p>

		<p>Dirk is also interested in the Cooper-Bessemer for sale I heard about a while back.  I just checked and it's still <a href="http://seattle.craigslist.org/est/for/689083253.html">posted on Craigslist</a>.  [posting since expired]
