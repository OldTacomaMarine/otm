		<h1>2008 Week 22 in Review</h1><br>
		<h3>May 25 to May 31, 2008</h3><br><br>

				<h2>Back to Business</h2>

		<p>I started this week with a lot of catching up in the office and at the shop.  This meant billing, several trips each to the bank, Kinkos, and the post office.</p>

		<p>I also spent several hours on the phone, including straightening out the mess I got into with AT&amp;T for using my new phone in Canada.  I can tell you all cell phone companies are jerks, but if you really hold them down you might get someone on the line who is really helpful.  It can be entertaining.</p>

		<p>I stalled the person who first took my call with all sorts of inane questions.  He would tell me there wasn't anything he could do and then ask &quot;is there anything I help with, sir?&quot; and I'd ask another question to keep him on the line.  I also insisted that I want the same top-quality service that Tom Cruise gets (though this guy said they treat all their customers with the same respect) and I guess they wrote it down in my file.  After stalling for another half-hour, they handed me off to someone who finally straightened it all out (and told me that <i>all</i> their customers receive the same great service).</p>

		<p>The trouble all started because after ten years of abuse I just switched from Sprint to AT&amp;T (to use my new iPhone).  New customers are treated like untrustworthy criminals for 90 days, but I got around that by hanging on and had about $700 in &quot;roaming charges&quot; knocked off my statement.</p>

		<h2>Lightship Lumber Planning</h2>

		<p>I finally started the real work on writing the bid request for the Lightship #83 deck lumber.  Brian Johnson of Ocean Bay Marine Inc and I took measurements and discussed quality requirements for the deck lumber.  We also took some samples:</p>

		<p>We need over 10,000 board feet of planking, plus nib planking, coverboards, marginboards, carlins, and winch pads.</p>

		<p>We should have a draft to Northwest Seaport for review by next Wednesday.</p>

		<h2>Work on the fireboat <i>Duwamish</i></h2>

		<p>Also this week, I disassembled the aft air compressor in the fireboat <i>Duwamish</i>.  From looking at the make, I think that the aft air compressor was installed with the Cooper-Bessemers and the forward one was replaced more recently.   After inspecting it, I don't think that the replacement is able to produce the 600 psi required for the <i>Duwamish</i>'s high-pressure system. I'm going look in to repairing the damaged one, which has been stored on deck under a rain cover, but it looks like it'll be a lot of work.</p>

		<p>An interesting thing about the original air compressors is that they're mostly brass, and may have been the same make of air compressor used to start the stainless steel Clevelands in minesweepers.  These engines use the same high-pressure settings that the Cooper-Bessemers in the fireboat use, so it'd make sense that they have the same kind of compressors.</p>

		<p>If anyone has any information about air compressors like those used in minesweepers, <a href="http://oldtacomamarine.wordpress.com/contact-old-tacoma-marine-inc/">contact me</a>, or write about it on the <a href="http://www.websitetoolbox.com/mb/oldtacomamarine">discussion board</a>.</p>

		<h2>Old Tugboats Changing Hands</h2>

		<p>Craig stopped by for a tour of South Lake Union last week.  He's got some neat stories of large-bore Sulzers and crossing oceans on container ships.  He is still looking for his dream steel tugboat with a heavy-duty to cruise the Sound with.  Comment here with your recommendations.</p>

		<p>I also learned that Skip bought another old tug: a Miki tug named the <i>Galene</i> down in Portland, powered by a 1,200 horsepower Superior. This sounds like a gigantic project and I hope he can handle it.</p>

		<h2>A Visit from Captain Jake</h2>

		<p>Captain Jake, currently of the <a href="http://www.sdmaritime.com/">San Diego Maritime Museum</a>'s <i>Californian</i>, stopped by for a tour of South Lake Union.  I sailed with him back in '96 on the <a href="http://www.ladywashington.org/"><i>Lady Washington</i></a>.  He's still driving tall ships and has recently taken over the steam yacht <i>Medea</i> for the San Diego Maritime Museum.  I showed him around the <a href="../washington/arthur.html"><i>Arthur Foss</i></a> and the fireboat <i>Duwamish</i>, and he rattled off a bunch of heavy-duty powered boats in southern California (with gossip).  I'll have to follow that information up now that I'm done with the <i>Pearl</i>.</p>

		<h2>New York Planning</h2>

		<p>I made some plans for the New York trip later this month.  We'll be visiting three fireboats (including the two powered by Enterprises that posted about <a href="http://www.websitetoolbox.com/tool/post/oldtacomamarine/vpost?id=2754038">here</a>), <a href="http://www.southstreetseaport.com/">South Street Seaport</a>, and hopefully Staten Island and some of the cool boats over there.</p>

		<h2>July work on the <i>Sobre las Olas</i></h2>

		<p>I've re-scheduled a trip to LA this July for some more work on the <a href="../atlas/sobre1.html"><i>Sobre las Olas</i></a>, the Atlas-powered fantail yacht.  The Sobre's mechanic John Olson got most of the snifters and all of the blow-down valves off of the two engines, and he's going to send them up for me to overhaul in my shop.  I'll bring them down with me to reinstall.  I'm looking forward to seeing the guys and the boat this summer.</p>

		<h2>International Retired Tugboat Association Party</h2>

		<p>On Saturday night, we attended the <a href="http://www.retiredtugs.org/">International Retired Tugboat Association</a> party in Everett.  Most of the party was onboard the <i>Olmstead</i>, a 95-foot retired Navy tug of the same class as the <a href="../enterprise/marispearl.html"><i>Maris Pearl</i></a> and the <a href="../enterprise/redcloud.html"><i>Red Cloud</i></a>.  I took a picture of the hold, which I uploaded <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/oldtacomamarine/2548389637/">here</a>.</p>

		<p>Lia and I arrived just in time to take a ride on a 60-foot tug (I can't remember its name) for a cruise on the Snohomish River, followed by drinks, snacks, and tugboat stories.  We passed by many neat old tugs, one of which I know very well: the <a href="../fairbanks/islandchampion.html"><i>Island Champion</i></a>.</p>

		<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oldtacomamarine/2573502442/"><img src="images/2008week22_2.jpg" border="0" alt="tugboat Island Champion, powered by a Fairbanks-Morse diesel engine, in Everett"></a></p>

		<p>The <i>Island Champion</i> is a classic 100-foot wooden tug from 1944 with a (6)33f14 <a href="http://www.oldtacomamarine.com/fairbanks/index.html">Fairbanks-Morse</a> main.  Hilbert and Jeanne, the proud owners, have had lots of work done in the last few years on the engine, the deck, and the hull, but unfortunately the boat spent one tide exchange under the Snohomish Slough.</p>

		<p>Here's the sad story:</p>

		<p>Last spring, I was helping Hilbert move the boat back to her very inconvenient moorage, where she regularly sits in the mud (the Snohomish River has lots of space for old tugs to tie up, but it's a tidal estuary and I wouldn't call the moorage great).  When arriving at the dock a little late on the tide, we decided to turn the boat around and quickly learned that we couldn't rely on the prop-walk when we're in such shallow water (the wheel is too close to the bottom).  This made turning around very difficult and after using up all the air and failing to pivot the boat with the bow in the bank, we thought we'd better get back to the dock even if we were pointed the wrong way.  While backing up to the dock, the boat got hung up on something - maybe a root ball.  Even with the Fairbanks wound up at 350 rmp (50 over max rated) we couldn't get the boat loose.  A bystander took a video of our fruitless efforts from the riverbank that's on YouTube <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=x92t9v-77-0">here</a>.</p>

		<p>We put all ashore except for Hilbert and I.  I called <a href="http://www.gdiving.com/">Global Dive and Salvage</a>, who I worked for back in '98 and '99. Hilbert and I prepared the boat for listing over and hoped that she'd float again on the next tide.</p>

		<p>Then the Global guys arrived with trucks and boats and big pumps.  We got the pumps off the trucks and into the small boats and got to the Island Champion just as the tide came up over her decks.  Before we could get the pumps installed, the water started flooding in through the salon doors and galley doors and completely filled the engine room.  By the time we had the pumps set up, it was too late to make any progress against the tide and we shifted our efforts to containing the fuel and oil.  We anchored an oil containment boom and plugged the fuel tank vents, trying to keep petroleum out of the river:</p>

		<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oldtacomamarine/2592967815/"><img src="images/2008week22_3.jpg" border="0" alt="the tugboat ISLAND CHAMPION, aground in the mud in Everett Slough"></a></p>

		<p>Later that night, we saw fuel begin to appear in the containment boom and found that the base of the fuel tank vent was completely rusted away.  The Global Dive crew and I worked through the night to soak up the fuel with pads.  I don't know how many piles of soaked pads we bagged up, taped closed, and hauled up the dock.</p>

		<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oldtacomamarine/2592967889/"><img src="images/2008week22_4.jpg" border="0" alt="the ISLAND CHAMPION, while aground in Everett Slough"></a></p>

		<p>Around 7 AM, divers showed up to seal the tug up and pump out all the tanks and the engine room.  That's when I left, totally exhausted.  The <i>Island Champion</i> was raised on the next tide and delivered to the Everett Shipyard to be cleaned out.</p>

		<p>Since then, Hilbert and Jeanne have been working very hard to put the boat back together and have had lots of good work done.  I wouldn't say that the incident <i>helped</i> the vessel, but in a way it's boosted the progress: they've had to work a lot faster to keep up with repairs and maintenance on the <i>Island Champion</i>.  I look forward to seeing her cruise again soon.</p>
