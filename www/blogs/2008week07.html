		<h1>2008 Week 7 in Review</h1><br>
		<h3>February 10 to February 16, 2008</h3><br><br>
				
		<p>This has been a busy week for Old Tacoma Marine Inc.  In addition to our usual winter maintenance load, the museum program schedule is picking up and we're getting a lot of interest in old diesels following our increased web presence.</p>

		<p>First, a variety of engine and vessel news:</p>

		<h2><i>Maris Pearl</i> Updates</h2>

		<p>Jay, Charlie, and I started the week by moving the <a href="../enterprise/marispearl.html"><i>Maris Pearl</i></a> from Lake Union Dry Dock back to Shilshole Marina.  It was a pretty uneventful trip.</p>

		<p>OTM Inc checked in with Alaska Copper and Brass again about the cooler for the tug's <a href="../enterprise/index.html">Enterprise diesel</a>.  Wayne reported no progress, so I threatened to go down there and roll the tubes myself.  Next Monday, I think I'll show up at their plant with my work boots and hard hat.</p>

		<p>I also talked with Rick Hamborg, new owner of the <i>Red Cloud</i>, about the extra <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oldtacomamarine/2249813016/">control head</a> that I'd like to purchase for the <i>Maris Pearl</i>.  I think we might be able to reach a deal soon.</p>

		<h2><i>Arthur Foss</i>'s Bearing</h2>

		<p>OTM Inc picked up the throw-out bearing for the Washington diesel in the <a href="../washington/arthur.html"><i>Arthur Foss</i></a>:</p>

		<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oldtacomamarine/2279957983/"><img src="images/2008week07_1.jpg" alt="tugboat ARTHUR FOSS's throw-out bearing, re-babbitted and ready for installation" border="0"></a></p>

		<p>Everett Engineering did a great job, although Dan Martin overrode my request for more fore-and-aft thrust clearance so that the tight fit will hold oil better.  I'm afraid that it will be much harder to center the bearing every time the propeller shaft is engaged.  The clutch on the <i>Arthur Foss</i> uses a set of links that flop over-center in a way that maintains pressure on the clutch without force from the throw-out bearing.  When the throw-out bearing is backed off a little, there is no thrust pressure at all.  The centering is sometimes hard, as the big wheel that moves the bearing is touchy.  We'll probably want to engineer a clamp or holder of some type to maintain the bearing position while underway.  The collar and bearing were installed on Thursday, but the links need to be cleaned.  They'll be installed early next week.</p>

		<h2><i>David B</i> Propeller Work</h2>

		<p>I talked with Jeffrey on the <a href="../washington/davidb.html"><i>David B</i></a>, which is hauled-out in preparation for propeller work.  They also want to replace the stern bearing due to the 1/4 inch clearance recorded, but the rudder is in the way of the bearing housing.  It looks like Jeffrey will need to remove the short intermediate shaft in order to remove the bearing housing, but the tail shaft will be even harder to remove.  I'm wondering if they'll replace the bearing without cleaning the shaft lining.  Jeffrey's frustration makes me think so.</p>

		<h2>Update on the <i>Catalyst</i>'s Cylinder Heads</h2>

		<p>The<a href="../washington/catalyst.html"><i>Catalyst</i></a>'s owners have reached an agreement with Empire Motors to purchase the three new cylinder heads (previously mentioned <a href="2008week04.html">here</a>) as well as the patterns.  I'm really looking forward to seeing them and I hope they work.  I'm also really, really excited to see the patterns.  I'll post lots of pictures when they get here.</p>

		<h2>Fairbanks-Morse Parts</h2>

		<p>Steve from <a href="http://www.striegelsupply.com/">Striegel Supply</a> is looking for some <a href="../Fairbanks/index.html">Fairbanks-Morse</a> parts for a blower on a 16&quot;-bore engine.  I don't know who would have these parts-does anyone reading this have any ideas?  Leave a comment - or better yet, post on our <a href="http://www.websitetoolbox.com/mb/oldtacomamarine/">discussion board</a>!</p>

		<h2>A Fairbanks-Morse in Maryland</h2>

		<p>I talked with John in Maryland this week.  He has a <a href="../fairbanks/index.html">Fairbanks-Mors</a> FM-A-6 engine, like the one on the <a href="../Fairbanks/johnncobb.html"><i>John Cobb</i></a>.  He'll be sending us photographs and information soon.  He's also trying to locate spare parts just in case; I recommended Hatch and Kirk overhaul the injectors and pumps for him.</p>

		<h2>An Atlas-Imperial in Astoria</h2>

		<p>OTM Inc received an email from the <a href="http://www.crmm.org">Columbia River Maritime Museum</a> in response to a letter we sent informing the museum of some small problems with their <a href="../atlas/index.html">Atlas-Imperial</a> on display.  They don't want to work on the engine right now (especially since it's on display in the main lobby - though I think that working on it right there would be very interesting for visitors), but they do want a list of what to do and how to do it for future planning.  I'll come up with a detailed list and maybe make a copy of one of our manuals to hand-deliver in March.</p>

		<h2>An Enterprise in Astoria</h2>

		<p>I received an email from John Gillon of Portland, Oregon:</p>

		<p><i>I am a volunteer with the amphibious forces memorial museum.  Last October we sailed the Sakarissa from San Francisco to Portland Or.  She is moored on the Columbia River next to our Landing Craft Infantry 713.</i></p>

		<p><i>I was looking on your web site and we have a Enterprise engine on the Sakarissa and it is a beautiful engine. You can visit our web site and see more, or contact them for some good pictures of the engine.</i></p>

		<p><i>I enjoyed your web site,</i></p>

		<p><i>John</i></p>

		<p>The <a href="http://www.amphibiousforces.org/">Amphibious Forces Memorial Museum</a> has hidden the pictures of its Enterprise too well for me to find, so I'll have to see if I can visit the <i>Sakarissa</i> while I'm Astoria for the Columbia River Maritime Museum errand:</p>

		<h2>The Ballard Maritime Academy Engineer for a Day Program</h2>

		<p>Preparing for a course like this is a hectic process, as the boats always require some head-scratching and jury-rigging to get them running after a long idle period.  The biggest puzzle we faced this time was getting enough air pressure to start the fireboat <i>Duwamish</i>'s diesel-electric system.  The fireboat's air compressors need a little work; one of them really doesn't pump air at all, and the other one's efficiency is suffering.  It takes a <i>long</i> time for it to fill the tanks up to the minimum level needed to turn the main over, so for past Engineer for a Day programs we've run an air hose from the <i>Arthur Foss</i> to the fireboat to fill up the tanks.</p>

		<p>This past autumn, though, we moved the boats on the Historic Ships Wharf around so that the <i>Arthur</i> and the <i>Duwamish</i> are separated by a big old Lightship (number 83).  If we use a long enough hose to stretch up and over the lightship and down into the fireboat, it doesn't effectively fill up the tanks.  Grant and I spend most of Thursday running the air compressor on auxiliary generator, wondering if we'd get enough pressure to turn on the main.  We thought about renting an air compressor, but couldn't find a large enough one on short-notice.</p>

		<p>Finally, late in the day, the <i>Duwamish</i>'s own air compressor filled up the tanks to the needed psi and Grant was able to start up the number one main generator:</p>

		<object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/VbXDZV_SqSI&hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/VbXDZV_SqSI&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object>

		<p>We ran it and the generator for a while after that to ensure that we had enough air built up to start the engine several times, since that's a key part of the Engineer for a Day program.</p>

		<p>While Grant was working on the <i>Duwamish</i>, cleaning and oiling and turning over the three big Bessemer generators, I was doing some work on the <i>Arthur Foss</i>.  We'd removed the base doors during the autumn 2007 Diesel Engine Theory course (pictures at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nwseaport/collections/72157603321537252/">Northwest Seaport's Flickr account</a>), and I needed to re-seal them using my own patented &quot;goo&quot; method.  Five of these doors are the original aluminum with &quot;Washington Iron Works&quot; cast into them, but one is a replacement made of plywood.  Northwest Seaport's museum specialist is hoping to replace this replacement door with a piece of thick plexiglass so that we can see into the engine while it's running, but they weren't able to get it purchased and cut in time for this class.  They're aiming to get it installed in time for the summer tour season, though.  I doubt that they'll be able to see much through all the oil that'll get splashed against the door while the engine is operating, but it's a neat idea and no harm in implementing it (at least until I have a new door cast in aluminum).</p>

		<p>The <i>Virginia V</i> at least was ready to go - though this is only because we don't start up her steam plant during the Engineer for a Day program (it would double the cost of the class).  Her power plant is currently disassembled for winter maintenance, but that actually makes it even more interesting to observe.</p>

		<p>After all that preparation, the Engineer for a Day program went <i>great</i>.  <a href="http://www.seattleschools.org/area/main/TeacherParent?classfind=612&amp;wrapper=0">John Foster</a>, the instructor for the Ballard Maritime Academy, brought 16 kids down for one of the program's annual field trips.  He spends several classes before the field trip teaching the kids about marine engineering and engine theory so that they have a good understanding of it in their heads before they step aboard.  When we have them actually start up an engine - either the <i>Arthur</i>'s Washington or the <i>Duwamish</i>'s Bessemers - they suddenly <i>understand</i> what the diagrams and explanations mean:</p>

		<p>Despite this, I'm always a little nervous thinking about a big group of kids storming the boat.  Once they arrive and we break them into three groups to cycle through the <i>Arthur</i>, the <i>Duwamish</i>, and the <i>Virginia V</i>, I usually calm down.  They may be high schoolers, but they want to be there and are way smarter than I give them credit for - even if they play games and whisper and text message while they're supposed to be listening.  I had a great time leading them through the <i>Arthur</i>'s start-up and shut-down procedures, and both Grant and Gary say the same thing about their sections.  I'm looking forward to doing as many of these as we can, and not just for Ballard Maritime Academy.</p>

		<h2>Inaugural Tugboat Night!</h2>

		<p>The week <i>finally</i> ended with OTM Inc helping run a new program with <a href="http://www.nwseaport.org">Northwest Seaport</a> and the <a href="http://www.cwb.org">Center for Wooden Boats</a>.  Tugboat Night was designed to serve three different purposes: to provide a regular, low-cost program on the <i>Arthur Foss</i>, to exercise all of the tug's equipment more often, and to get more people onboard and involved with the boat and the organizations.</p>

		<p>On Saturday night, twelve people showed up for the program, all really excited.  Several had never been onboard before, though they'd seen the tug at the dock.  My original plan for the evening had been to lead all the participants through the boat starting in the engine room, turning on everything and then turning off everything.  After running the auxiliary generator and the AC generator, though, we ended up getting distracted by the main engine and not going on to the steering equipment and other systems.  Everyone loves watching the Washington Iron Works diesels, since they have so many exposed moving parts and ways to see into the engine.  We played with the controls, trying to get the engine to idle as slow as possible before stalling, and I answered a lot of questions from both beginners and the professional electrical engineer who had run hydroelectric generators in Montana:</p>

		<p>This, however, is the great thing about Tugboat Night.  Next time, we'll do it differently; we could have other instructors up in the fo'c'sle or the wheelhouse while I stay in the engine room and let participants choose where they go, or we could spend less time on the pre-start checklists and just turn things on and off.  We could have a &quot;plumbing night&quot; or a &quot;wiring night&quot; or a &quot;steering and telegraph night,&quot; as well as a &quot;deck department&quot; or an &quot;engine department&quot; night.</p>

		<p>I'm really excited by the turn-out of this first session, since it shows that people are interested in learning about the gritty details of old boats.  I think that it's a great way to start building a volunteer engine crew for the <i>Arthur</i>, both to help keep up with maintenance and repair, and for in the future when the tug starts cruising again (though that's barely on the horizon).  I hope that see all the same people at the next Tugboat Night, plus more who hear about it from them.</p>

		<p>NWS and the CWB have scheduled four more sessions of Tugboat Night, on April 19, June 21, August 16, and December 20.  Depending on the popularity of the class, they may hold more this year, and they're planning to hold one every month of 2009.  Call the CWB at (206) 382-2628 to register <i>now</i>.</p>

		<h2>Finally, Tape versus No Tape: A Viewer Poll</h2>

		<p>Kirtland (a boat guy living aboard the <i>Arthur Foss</i> these days in a work-exchange arrangement with Northwest Seaport) and I had a &quot;discussion&quot; the other day about paint on boats.  It went sort of like the Bud Light &quot;great tastes&quot; versus &quot;less filling&quot; commercials.</p>

		<p>It is my philosophy that paint is an impermeable barrier that protects the ship from rot, rust, and other elemental damage.  It is Kirtland's philosophy that paint is a cosmetic that keeps the boat looking sharp and shipshape.  Of course, what we <i>actually</i> said was something like &quot;Next time, use tape, [censored]!&quot;  &quot;You want tape?  Beat me to it, [censored]!&quot; and back and forth several times.</p>

		<p>Now, I'm a big proponent of keeping the boats looking sharp so that the maritime groups have good &quot;dock presence,&quot; but before worrying about making them look good we should worry about keeping them protected from the rain and other agents of deterioration.  If Kirtland wants to spend a lot of time fussing over masking and detailing and what should be painted green versus white, then that's fine - as long as the boat is already protected.</p>

		<p>Readers, what do you think?  Paint as protective barrier or paint as a cosmetic detail?  Please comment with your opinion.</p>
