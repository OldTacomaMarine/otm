		<h1>2009 Week 19 in Review</h1><br>
		<h3>May 3 to May 9, 2009</h3><br><br>

		<h2>Breaking down the party</h2>

		<p>I spent the first part of the week finishing the big M4 Party.  Volunteers and I worked around the clock to clean up and return all the stuff, following the amazing show.  Thanks to all those who helped this year!</p>

		<p>If you want to be involved in the next M4 party, please contact me and I'll put you in touch with the crew.</p>

		<h2>Preparing for Illinois</h2>

		<p>I talked two weeks ago about how I'd been talking with the <a href="../fairbanks/indiangrave1.html">Indian Grave Pump House</a> in Illinois about installing re-babbitted main bearings in their <a href="../fairbanks/index.html">Fairbanks-Morse</a> engines.  I ended Week 17 hearing &quot;we're waiting for the bearings to come back from the shop,&quot; and by this week they were back to &quot;hurry hurry hurry,&quot; so I'm getting ready to go to Illinois again.</p>

		<p>I picked up more lapping compound (a big 5lb bucket this time), and cleaned up the shop.  This time, the trip is indefinitely long, so I had to be sure the bills are paid and the chickens have feed.  It'll probably be two or three weeks, so stay tuned for blogs from the Midwest.</p>

		<h2>Business as usual</h2>

		<p>OTM Inc got audited by the insurance company.  Lame.</p>

		<h2>Elliott Bay Tugboat Races</h2>

		<p>On Saturday, OTM Inc went to the tugboat races on Elliott Bay aboard the <a href="../enterprise/marispearl.html"><i>Maris Pearl</i></a>.  It was a great day for racing, and we had a blast:</p>

		<p>We also saw the <a href="../washington/fearless.html"><i>Fearless</i></a> out in fine form:</p>

		<h2>Tugboat Night!</h2>

		<p>We had another session of Tugboat Night aboard the <a href="../washington/arthur.html"><i>Arthur Foss</i></a>.  The next session is June 13, so we'll see you there!</p>

		<h2>Labor versus Capital</h2>

		<p>There's been lots of talk about our ideas of labor changing these days, but I want to know if our ideas of efficiency will change.  I think it might have to.</p>

		<p>Let's say we give billions to the auto industry so that they can keep people employed.  We as tax payers will pay them to make cars, but then no one wants to buy them.  Did it work? No but if we give billions to an auto industry that makes cars by hand, using hand tools.  And turn out less cars people keep their jobs.</p>

		<p>By the same token, if we give billions to highway improvement, it will be under the banner of creating jobs and employing people.  It sounds like a good idea, but I'm worried that what will happen when the government starts awarding contracts.  If the lowest bidder is the company that wants to buy a big automatic highway re-paving machine that was made in China and can be driven by one person, then did the plan work? I say that it didn't, if the original plan was to create jobs (unless we're counting off-shore manufacturing jobs).</p>

		<p>I'm worried that billions will go to replace old diesels for no reason except to keep the Chinese who build Caterpillars employed for another day.  Ultimately the money earmarked for a cleaner and better running fleet should be spent to have engineers and mechanics replace the rings and injectors.  A billion dollars can service a lot of engines and keep people employed right here - plus it will help protect the environment by both cutting emissions and preventing new engines to be shipped around the world and old engines to be shipped to the scrappers.</p>

		<p>Really, if we clean up the engines that are already in use, the benefits will be compounded.  We'll have cleaner air, more work with less capital investment, a better life for mid-level educated folks, and no artificially-created demand for the new products.  All the equipment serviced will already be in demand due to the fact that someone owns it.</p>

		<p>So, government folks, please stop creating meaningless capital investment and buy labor, instead.  There are millions of ways to improve the world with out making anything.
