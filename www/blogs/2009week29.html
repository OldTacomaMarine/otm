		<h1>2009 Week 29 in Review</h1><br>
		<h3>July 12 to July 19, 2009</h3><br><br>

		<h2>News from Alaska</h2>

		<p>I'm onboard the <a href="../washington/catalyst.html"><i>Catalyst</i></a> again and I'm meeting boat friends everywhere: the crew from the <i>Liseron</i>, former crewmates Chuck and Nissa from the <i>Mist Cove</i>, and the crew from the <i>Catalyst</i>, who are all being relieved today by a whole new crew.  Captain Steve, chef Lisa, deckhand Lia, and I will be running the boat together for the next few weeks.</p>

		<p>Lia and I flew in on Saturday and after some last-minute chores and drinks at the Alaskan hotel, we picked up our passengers on Sunday and headed out to Endicott Arm.</p>

		<p>This week's cruise was from Juneau to Petersburg, stopping at Sanford Cove, Fords Terror, West Brother, Sheldon Cove, West Brother, and Scenery Cove along the way</p>

		<p>We kayaked through Fords Terror, picked up a bunch of Dungeness crabs at Wood Spit, made a campfire on West Brother in Frederic Sound, and watched some bears in Sheldon cove.</p>

		<p>We got to Sheldon cove early, so I pulled four valves to clean and swap.  I exchange intake for exhaust valves every so often so that they wear evenly and we get more life out of them.  <a href="../washington/index.html">Washingtons</a> are hard on their valves for some reason.</p>

		<p>We liked West Brother so much that we stopped there again and this time we had Norio Matsumoto over for dinner.  He's a great wilderness photographer and he showed a slide show of his work.  On the way to Thomas Bay we watched some whales, then anchored in Scenery Cove and went for a walk to Baird Glacier.</p>

		<p>Once we got to Petersburg, the whole crew was anxious to connect with the world we all had a cell phone attached to one ear while cleaning the boat, provisioning, and doing other chores.</p>

		<p>This week was so nice.  Getting aboard <i>Catalyst</i> was like coming home and I ran into each room to revisit great memories and see that everything is still where I left it.  Frederick Sound is also some of the best cruising in the world - especially with the great weather we're having.  I have never seen so much sun up here.  It made the glacier a beautiful sparkling blue, and it was so warm I could wear shorts and a t-shirt while on our hike there.</p>

		<p><strong>Engineer's Log</strong></p>

		<p>Valves from 1 and 2 pulled, cleaned, and swapped in for out<br>
		Ex-valve for #3 reinstalled after Eric pulled it<br>
		Wiggled cord for the shaft tachometer; no improvement, still reading really low or not at all<br>
		Re-soldered wire to stateroom five port forward reading light<br>
		Cleaned and flushed bilge</p>

		<p>We also did the numbers for this trip, the 11th of the 2009 season:</p>

		<p>hours underway: 52:45<br>
		hours on main: 53.8<br>
		hours on the generator: 35:.6<br>
		hours on the water maker: 17:45<br>
		miles traveled: 231<br>
		gallons of fuel used: 179<br>
		gallons of water made: 1,035<br>
		gallons of gas used: 8.8<br>
		gallons of propane: 4.5<br>
		gallons of lube oil: 4<br>
		qts of half and half: used 6 (unusually high)</p>

		<p>And finally, here's a tasty recipe from the <i>Catalyst</i>'s galley:</p>

		<p><strong>Crab</strong><br>
		drop crab pots in 40 feet of water in top secret location with herring bait caught from just off the Taku fishery pier.<br>
		soak for one to two days, pull<br>
		return small ones and females<br>
		pull all legs of each crab, bracing the center of the body on the boat rail; legs and body meat should come right out of shell<br>
		scrape off gills<br>
		boil for 11 minutes<br>
		shell and eat</p>

		<p><i>Kitchen notes</i>: Crab-eaters of the world are divided into two groups: pilers and gobblers.  Gobblers eat each piece of crab as they pull it out of the shell, while pilers pile up their pieces on their plate.  Pilers beware, for the gobblers are happy to steal your pile.</p>

		<p>Finally, crab-crackers are for newbies.</p>

		<h2>Waving to the Heavy-Duties</h2>

		<p>On the way into Petersburg, I saw the <a href="../washington/katahdin.html"><i>Katahdin</i></a>, the <a href="../enterprise/barronisland.html"><i>Barron Islands</i></a>, and the <a href="../enterprise/capescott.html"><i>Cape Cross</i></a>, each powered by a heavy-duty.  It's great to see the old workboat yachts out there.</p>

		<h2>More scraping at Indian Graves</h2>

		<p>In news beyond Alaska, I heard that the <a href="../fairbanks/indiangrave3.html">Indian Grave engine #3</a> ran for an hour and then the #2 main bearing got hot, so they scraped it down some more.  This isn't unusual - even with a good pattern on the bearing and the engine turning by hand really smooth, more scraping is often required after actually running the engine the first few times.  Sounds like it's going well.</p>

		<h2>Sexy sailor women</h2>

		<p>Diana the OTM Inc museologist had pictures taken for the 2010 Sexy Women of Maritime Calendar produced by <a href="http://jacktar.org/">Jack Tar Magazine</a> this week.  Apparently, the photos turned out great, but you'll have to buy the calendar to see them because she isn't sharing.</p>

		<h2>Social Networking</h2>

		<p>Old Tacoma Marine Inc. joined <a href="http://www.theboaters.com/">TheBoaters.com</a>, which is like Facebook for boat trash.  <a>Check us out!</a></p>

		<h2>New owner for the <i>Sound</i></h2>

		<p>I heard that Anthony bought the <a href="../enterprise/sound.html"><i>Sound</i></a>.  Poor sucker - he already owns the <a href="../enterprise/chief.html"><i>Chief</i></a>.  I love <a href="../enterprise/specs.html">Enterprises</a>, but there is such thing as <i>too</i> much of a good thing.</p>
