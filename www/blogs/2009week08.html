		<h1>2009 Week 8 in Review</h1><br>
		<h3>February 15 to February 21, 2009</h3><br><br>

		<p>After dropping off the <a href="../washington/catalyst.html"><i>Catalyst</i></a> On the way back from Friday Harbor, I took a sea plane back to Seattle.  We stopped in Westsound to pick up more passengers, and I got to see the <a href="../atlas/elcapitan.html"><i>El Capitan</i></a>:</p>

		<p>Then, with finished up, OTM Inc took the opportunity to clean out the shop this week.  We also caught up on some office business, and did a lot of work on <i>Skillful</i>:</p>

		<h2>Parts from the <i>Ked</i></h2>

		<p>On my way to the <i>Skillful</i> after leaving my truck in the yard, I walked by <a href="http://www.stabbertmaritime.com/">Stabberts</a>, which just broke up the <a href="http://www.kitsapsun.com/news/2008/aug/31/declared-145derelict-world-war-ii-tanker-makes/"><i>Ked</i></a>.  I saw what's left of it: just a pile of <a href="../fairbanks/index.html">Fairbanks</a> engine parts, removed in a hurry with a gas axe (cutting torch).  They blasted away the bolt heads and even cut the rods in half to get the engine out, but there're still some big pieces left:</p>

		<p>The yard guys said that they thought it was just going to the recycle, but I knew from talking with my friend Nobby that they were headed for Brooklyn as as parts for the old oil tanker <a href="http://www.portsidenewyork.org/mary_whalen%20history.htm"><i>Mary Whelan</i></a>.  These folks have apparently been trying to get the <i>Ked</i> parts for a while.  They have a blog entry from September (<a href="http://portsidetanker.blogspot.com/2008/09/can-ked-help-whalen.html">here</a> that details how they found out about the <i>Ked</i>, and another one that leading up to getting the parts (<a href="http://www.portsidenewyork.org/mary_whalen%20history.htm">here</a>).  It sounds like the <i>Mary Whelan</i> folks have been discovering for themselves what OTM Inc has been preaching - that old engines in old boats are a great way to hold interesting museum programming.  I hope to get out to see the boat and the programs soon - and call me if you want help setting up a diesel engine restoration workshop.</p>

		<h2>Tugboat for sale</h2>

		<p>I heard about an old tug for sale up in Anacortes, Washington.  It's an 86-foot ex-army tug powered by a 650 horsepower Sulser main.  The tug was &quot;ST-893&quot; during its working days, and you can purchase it for $190,000.  There's a listing <a href="http://www.yachtworld.fr/core/listing/boatFullDetails.jsp?boat_id=1891213&amp;ybw=&amp;units=Feet&amp;currency=USD&amp;access=Public">here</a>.</p>

		<h2>Patrol boat for sale</h2>

		<p>I took a visit to the <i>Oceanid</i>, a steam patrol boat that the <a href="http://www.nwschooner.org">Northwest Schooner Society</a> is trying to sell.  It's a rad steamboat for sale with its reciprocating steam engine still intact:</p>

		<p>It's really awesome, but it needs a <i>lot</i> of work.  If you're interested, contact me, and I'll pass it along.</p>

		<h2>OTM Inc joins Biznik</h2>

		<p>I signed up at <a href="http://biznik.com/">Biznik</a> this week.  Take a look at my <a href="http://biznik.com/members/adrian-lipp">profile</a> and add me to your network.</p>
