		<h3>April 13 to April 19, 2008</h3><br><br>

		<h2>An Update on the <i>Maris Pearl</i></h2>

		<p>I finally finished pipe fitting for the <a title="retired tugboat Maris Pearl, ex-Sea Fox" href="../enterprise/marispearl.html"><i>Maris Pearl</i></a>'s oil cooler and flushed all the lines in preparation for sea trials!  On Wednesday, Jay, Dan, and I cruised the boat around Puget Sound to test systems.   Everything went just fine.  There are still some small issues to be worked out, but the oil did heat up like we'd hoped.  Now I just need to get everything else finished before Jay takes the boat up to Alaska for the summer.</p>

		<h2>The <i>Nokomis</i>'s engine (and others like it)</h2>

		<p>I had a nice phone chat with John from Pasadena, Maryland about his retired ice breaker <a href="../fairbanks/nokomis.html"><i>Nokomis</i></a>.  The Nokomis is powered by a model (6) 31A6 1/4 (model list <a title="list of Fairbanks-Morse diesel engine sizes, specifications, and model numbers" href="../fairbanks/specs.html">here</a>) <a title="Diesel Engines manufactured by the Fairbanks-Morse Company" href="../fairbanks/index.html">Fairbanks-Morse</a>, a neat engine with a big flapper on the front for a blower.  This two-cycle engine runs with a growling sound at about 720 rpm when cranked up to full speed.</p>

		<p>The boat was built in 1951 and is 70 feet with a 20 foot beam.   John has put in a lot of work to clean it up and fires up many of the systems as often as he can.  He reports finding two fuel pumps frozen from rust, which he's sending out to be overhauled along with a spare.  When they get back, he'll be following the instruction manual closely to re-time them.</p>

		<p>John is also looking for other engines like the <i>Nokomis</i>'s to hear others' experiences with the A model -- plus where any potential spare parts may be obtained from.</p>

		<p>Here in Seattle, we have the <a title="Research vessel John N Cobb, powered by a Fairbanks-Morse diesel engine" href="../fairbanks/johnncobb.html"><i>John Cobb</i></a>, a research boat still used by <a title="the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration" href="http://www.noaa.gov">NOAA</a> to conduct fisheries studies in Alaska every summer.  The <i>Cobb</i> has a model &#40;8&#41; 31A10 engine - an eight-cylinder model similar to the <i>Nokomis</i>'s six-cylinder.  The other differences include the <i>Cobb</i>'s larger bore (10 versus 6 1/4), the reed valve plates for each cylinder in addition to the ones at the blower, and a slower running speed.  If anyone reading knows of another similar Fairbanks-Morse engine out there, leave a comment or <a href="http://www.websitetoolbox.com/tool/post/oldtacomamarine/vpost?id=2693235">join the discussion</a>.</p>

		<p>For extra experience, John also volunteers on the <a title="Wikipedia entry on the Lightship 116 Lightship, designated Chesapeake" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightship_Chesapeake">Chesapeake Lightship</a> at the <a title="the Baltimore Maritime Museum" href="http://www.baltomaritimemuseum.org/">Baltimore Maritime Museum</a> regularly.  Good luck with the <i>Nokomis</i>, John -- we are all looking forward to hearing a sound clip of her engine running, and hopefully a YouTube video or two.</p>

		<h2>Cooper-Bessemer for Sale</h2>

		<p>This week we got an email from Dave Thorson alerting us to the Cooper-Bessemer for sale very cheap in Cle Elum, Washington.   It's another neat old engine that no one I know wants to move.  I hope someone eventually take it on and fixes it up into a runner.   Mike Wallaston has the same engine in the <a title="the Northwest Marine Propulsion Museum's website at Ewing Street Moorings" href="http://www.ewingstreet.com/museum.htm">Northwest Marine Propulsion Museum</a>, but has not yet turned it into a display.  If anyone reading wants this engine, and I'll forward you to the owners.</p>

		<h2>Another One Bites the Dust</h2>

		<p>We heard a rumor that the <i>Oregon</i>'s <a href="../enterprise/index.html">Enterprise</a> is out and on the beach for sale <i>very</i> cheap. It is so sad to hear that another heavy-duty diesel bites the dust.  Once out of a boat, a classic engine like that rarely escapes the scrap yard.</p>

		<p>I wish I could report that a fancy new yacht (like the <a href="../enterprise/discovery.html"><i>Discovery</i></a>) intends to install it for the smooth propulsion, great low rumbling sound, the interesting history, the beautiful shape, the fuel economy, and the reliability of an old diesel-not to mention how fun they are.</p>

		<p>If anyone <i>does</i> want the engine installed, you can contact me and I'll forward the message along to the owners.</p>

		<h2>Life on the <i>Arthur Foss</i></h2>

		<p>In brighter news, we ended the week at <a href="http://www.nwseaport.org">Northwest Seaport</a> for a work party and the second session of Tugboat Night aboard the <a href="../washington/arthur.html"><i>Arthur Foss</i></a>.  During the work party, I led a crew that moved all the main engine's spare parts from the boat and outbuildings at Lake Union Park to <a href="http://www.nwschooner.org">Northwest Schooner Society</a>'s warehouse on Northlake Way.</p>

		<p>In addition to getting all the parts together in a secure on-land location, this was a great chance to get a full inventory of all the spares.  During our last two Diesel Engine Theory programs (this year's class at <a href="http://nwseaport.org/programs.html">Northwest Seaport's program page</a>), we rebuilt the valve cages and the fuel injectors from spare parts.  I knew that there were more components for more injectors in the spare parts collection, but now I (and NWS) know just how many of each there are.  Once they compile the list, we'll try to post a copy here.</p>

		<p>Following the work party, I helped run Tugboat Night.  Last time (at the end of <a href="2008week07.html">Week Seven</a>) we ran the generator (just a jimmy) and the main.  This time, we turned a lot more things on.  Before the class started, we ran the generator to make air, then turned on <i>everything</i> in the <i>Arthur</i> that we could: the interior lights (including all the reading lights over individual bunks), the navigation lights, the radar, and the radios (though something's busted and I couldn't get them to stay on).  When the participants showed up, we had them light the stove and then we cranked up the main several times.</p>

		<p>Then we did something new: we split the participants into two groups.  One group stayed in the engine room with me to practice bell drills and starting the main, the other group went up to the wheelhouse with Diana to &quot;steer&quot; the boat.  The <i>Arthur Foss</i> has two steering systems: the manual steering that uses the big wooden wheel and the armpower of whoever's in the bridge, and the power steering that uses a small bronze wheel and a hydraulic-over-pneumatic system.  Since the <i>Arthur</i>'s rudder is about 14 feet high and six feet wide, the power steering can really make a difference when handling the boat.</p>

		<p>Since the tug's steering gear really hasn't been exercised much since she stopped cruising in 2001, and since the goal of Tugboat Night is to turn everything on that we can, we powered up the steering gear and let participants turn the rudder back and forth at the dock.  The difference between the two systems is pretty interesting to feel: the manual steering is really stiff but you can yank on the wheel as hard as you want, while the power steering is smoother and needs a light touch to not sheer a delicate pin in the system.</p>

		<p>Everyone had a great time at this Tugboat Night, like the last.  We didn't have any repeat participants, but a couple people were out of town or already booked for the evening and swore they'd come next time.  The next session is Saturday, June 21.  Everyone should come.  No excuses.</p>

		<p>We didn't get to linger much after Tugboat Night, though; Diana had to drive out to Port Angeles to help friends move, while Lia and I jumped in the truck and drove to Bellingham for Jeffrey's (of the <a href="../washington/davidb.html">David B</a>) birthday party.</p>
