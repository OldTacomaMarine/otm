		<h1>2009 Week 31 in Review</h1><br>
		<h3>July 27 to August 1, 2009</h3><br><br>

		<p>This week's cruise aboard the <em><a href="http://www.oldtacomamarine.com/washington/catalyst.html">MV Catalyst</a></em> was from Craig to Petersburg, stopping at Port Mayoral, Squam, Whale Cove, Dry Pass, Labouchere Bay, and Kah Sheets Bay along the way. </p>

		<p>In Craig, we took our one last chance for a wifi signal and a greasy breakfast, then went to pick up our cargo. The document of lading listed an extended family, including three boys excited to catch fish. </p>

		<p>On the second day, we spent a few hours outside of Noise Island and watched an amazing sight: it was a very sunny day and the fog was rolling down the hills at 30 knots to then dissipate at the bottom. Watching this and a variety of coastal birds holing up in caves and holes in the jagged rock walls, while riding a long mellow NE swell, made my day. </p>

		<p>By Day Three, it was getting to be just like <em>Groundhog Day</em>: have coffee, start the main, and pull chain; but once we sped up, the engine room filled with smoke!! A quick look around showed that the throw-out bearing was hot hot hot. So I called the captain to request a slowdown, and then adjusted the shifting cylinder to center the throw-out bearing. The <em>Catalyst</em>'s throw-out bearing is solid brass, rather than poured babbitt within a big iron collar, so it can take getting heated up occasionally. </p>

		<p>We also went back to The Hole In the Ground by El Capitan Pass, and this time got a great tour. Then that afternoon, when we were waiting for our kayakers to come back, we decided it was finally time to fix the radar. This is a practical joke I've been playing since I was fifteen, and you have to build up to it by mentioning how the radar's acting wonky for a few days. This one kid on the trip was really interested and kept saying he'd help, so when we were waiting for the kayakers, I told him it was time to fix it. I put together an aluminum foil suit for him, complete with a salad bowl hat and an aluminum foil flag. </p>

		<p>He got more and more skeptical, but I kept reassuring him that this was what we had to do to fix the radar. After he was all suited up, we put him ashore with a radio and his flag and had him run back and forth along the beach, and wave the flag, and climb up onto driftwood, and really tested the radar a lot. Of course, we didn't actually have the radar <em>on</em> for the test, but he did a great job anyway, and we made sure to tell him so. </p>

		<p>Sure enough, the next day when we turned the radar back on, it worked just fine. </p>

		<p><strong>Engineer's Log</strong> </p>

		<p>And finally, here's a tasty recipe from the <em>Catalyst</em>'s galley: </p>
