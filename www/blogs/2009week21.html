		<h1>2009 Week 21 in Review</h1><br>
		<h3>May 17 to May 23, 2009</h3><br><br>

		<p>This week, OTM Inc is still in Illinois, fitting bearings.</p>

		<h2>Still scraping bearings</h2>

		<p>Last week, three of us started scraping the re-babbitted bearings into the <a href="../fairbanks/index.html">Fairbanks-Morse</a> diesels in Illinois.  We got everything set up and started barring the engine over so that the lapping compound could do its trick, but it was really painful.  The bearings don't fit very well yet, so it's really hard to turn the engine over and we were dying.  Keith went home on Friday vowing to invent a turning tool that would make it easier.  I took pictures of the one I saw in <a href="http://www.theonlyoblong.com/antique_engine/index.html">Oblong</a> and sent it to him, but he apparently came up with a couple different designs over the weekend.</p>

		<p>He brought one in on Monday and spent all morning adjusting it.  I didn't pay close attention, since I was still working on the bearings, but finally I heard the &quot;clang, clang, clang&quot; of the the pawls riding on the flywheel as it turns.  Sweet!</p>

		<p>It turns out that Keith used an electric motor coupled with a gear box with something like thirty-to-one reduction.  It's also a ninety-degree gear, so the output shaft is on the side.  He also hooked up a board and some wheels to give it leverage, and stretched two giant V-belts over the flywheel.  Brilliant!  It works really well and sped things <i>way</i> up:</p>

		<p>The three of us got into a good rhythm: Keith and Nathan would set in the bearings on Engine Two, then lap them while I scraped bearings for Engine Three.  Then, we would switch, so that Keith and Nathan were setting in the bearings that I'd just scraped.  We we cruised through alota bearings, but we've got a <i>lot</i> of fitting to do before we're done.</p>

		<h2>More old Fairbanks-Morses</h2>

		<p>Over the weekend, I went down to St. Louis to pick up the next set of bearings.  This time, I stopped at Keith's house in Carlinville to drop off the outer &quot;race,&quot; or rod bushing. Unlike other heavy duties I work on, <a href="../fairbanks/index.html">Fairbanks-Morse</a> diesels use needle bearings between the piston and the piston pin.  Lamar ordered new outer races made for Engine Three, which Keith will be installing at his shop.</p>

		<p>While in Carlinville, we just <i>happened</i> to stop in during the tractor show.  I got to see another Fairbanks diesel, this time a (2) 32E14 two-cylinder:</p>

		<p>Then on Sunday, I visited the <a href="http://pioneerpowershow.com/">Le Sueur Pioneer Power Show</a> grounds, where there's a (4) 32E12 that drives a generator.  Their building was closed, though, so I had to look through the window.  Lame.  They've got some small pictures of it posted on their website <a href="http://pioneerpowershow.com/diesel.html">here</a>, though.</p>

		<p>Anyway, these things are everywhere out here!  I love seeing all these great old diesels.  We're trying to get them all up on the website so you can see them, too.  I'll be in Illinois for a while longer, so if anyone reading knows of another heavy-duty to see, let me know.</p>
