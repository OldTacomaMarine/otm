		<h1>2009 Week 2 in Review</h1><br>
		<h3>January 4 to January 10, 2009</h3><br><br>

		<h2>Work continues on the <i>Catalyst</i></h2>

		<p>This week on the <a href="http://www.oldtacomamarine.com/washington/catalyst.html"><i>Catalyst</i></a>, we finished up the main bearings.  <a href=" week1.html">Last week</a> I talked about fitting in bearings and strain testing them and how it takes a long time, but they're finally done.  Whew.  Next up are the rod bearings, then the pistons.</p>

		<h2>An update on the <i>David B</i></h2>

		<p>As some of you may know, the <a href="http://www.oldtacomamarine.com/washington/davidb.html"><i>David B</i></a> suffered some damage in last month's big winter freeze.  I've been on the phone with owner Jeffery a lot, since he's trying to figure out how to best fix it.</p>

		<p>One of the fixes that Jeffery already did was to replace a chunk that blew out of the cylinder head.  The cylinder head is curved, so the replacement had to be on that same curve to be effective.  He could have hammered a flat piece of steel to the right shape, but that would have taken forever to get it the right shape and curve.  Instead, Jeffrey took a 16-inch pipe that had the same radius as the cracked head and cut a piece out of it that matched the hole in the cylinder head, and stitched it together with a bunch of screws.</p>

		<p>He did a really good job - I hope that the rest of the repairs go as well, and that the <i>David B</i> is cruising again soon.</p>

		<p><b>Old Tacoma Marine Art Show at Caprice Kitchen</b></p>

		<p>At the end of the week, I spent an evening at <a href="http://chefannecatherine.com/">Caprice Kitchen</a> helping set up an old engine art show.  We put up ten art-quality prints of some of our favorite engines, including the <a href="../washington/catalyst.html"><i>Catalyst</i></a>, the <a href="../washington/arthur.html"><i>Arthur Foss</i></a>, and the <a href="../washington/davidb.html"><i>David B</i></a>.</p>
