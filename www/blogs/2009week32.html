		<h1>2009 Week 32 in Review</h1><br>
		<h3>August 2 to August 8, 2009</h3><br><br>

		<p>This week's cruise aboard the <a href="http://www.oldtacomamarine.com/washington/catalyst.html"><em>MV Catalyst</em></a> was from Petersburg to Taku Harbor, stopping at Scenery Cove, Sheldon Cove, West Brother, Sanford Cove, and Fords Terror along the way. </p>

		<p>We picked up our people in Petersburg and got back in to Frederic Sound. Finally! Two weeks away and I'd missed it. Captain Bill was on the boat again as well as new chef Tracy. We went to Scenery Cove, then the Brothers. </p>

		<p>The weather was hot and dry, but it wasn't sunny; there was a strange haze all around us and a faint smell of smoke. It turns out that there's a lot of Canada and the Yukon on fire right now, and it's turning the coast hazy. We kinda felt cheated of our potential sun, but no one really complains as long as it's dry and calm. </p>

		<p>We pulled the old rubber fish iceberg trick again. Whenever we go to see the glacier at Fords Terror, we'll have an iceberg centerpiece on the dinner table that night. Once in a while, I'll freeze a rubber chicken or a fish in a bucket, and then switch it with the real centerpiece. The fish, as always, was a hit. </p>

		<p>Soon enough, another week had gone by and we were in Juneau again. We had a nice dinner at the Hangar and drinks with Anthony, who I sailed with on the <em>Mist Cove</em> years ago. </p>
