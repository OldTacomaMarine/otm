		<h1>2008 Week 39 in Review</h1><br>
		<h3>September 21 to September 27, 2008</h3><br><br>

		<h2>Back to business-as-usual</h2>

		<p>This week, I've gotten back in the shop.  I worked on cleaning up an engine control station that I picked up recently.  It's a neat find, perfect for a direct-reversing twin-screw boat.  After I finish cleaning it up, I'll post pictures and put it up on eBay - hopefully by next week.</p>

		<p>I also worked on the <i>Duwamish</i> a bit - I checked the cylinder height with a standard gasket and it is too low.  The piston goes up past the liner slightly, so next week I'll put a thicker gasket under it.  I've got to get this project wrapped up soon, though.</p>

		<p>I also cleaned up the shop a bit, and caught up on news from the shop partners.  Brian and his shipwright partners are all settled in, John moved out, Grant is moving into John's old space, and we're going to be looking for another shop partner soon.  My space is right in the center of the shop, so I spend quite a lot of time BSing with everyone who works there.  I call this an investment, rather than a waste of time.  We may not talk about anything important, but this business requires a lot of social interaction.  When I have a question, I can get answer much faster if I am all caught up on the news.</p>

		<p>I also worked on taxes and other &quot;business&quot; things.  Lame.  Stuff like this takes the fun out of running a small business.</p>

		<h2><i>Sakarissa</i> moves</h2>

		<p>We received the following email from Jerry, who works with the <a href="http://www.amphibiousforces.org"></a>Amphibious Forces Memorial Museum, which is thinking about buying the <a href="../enterprise/sakarissa.html"><i>Sakarissa</i></a> (a WWII &quot;Yard Tug,&quot; sister ship to the <a href="../enterprise/marispearl.html"><i>Maris Pearl</i></a> and the <a href="../enterprise/redcloud.html"><i>Red Cloud</i></a>):</p>

		<p><i>YTB-269 was built in Tacoma and commissioned 12 April 1944.  She served in the Pacific assisting in the operation and transport of ABSD-1 (advance base sectional dry-dock).  These large docks were capable of lifting a battleship and were used to repair ships in Eniwetok and Guam during and after the war.  The ship returned home to San Francisco on August 22, 1946.  She was used for assist duty for the USN until 1974 and was then transferred to MARAD at Suisan Bay tending to the needs of the mothball fleet there.  The </i>Sakarissa<i> will join the growing fleet of historic vessels in the Portland/Vancouver WA area.  She will become an educational resource attesting to the era when maritime services played a major role in the economy of the Northwest and of the labor that built ships and those few still working to preserve that history. </i></p>

		<p>Jerry also sent a bunch of pictures of the tug, including this engine room shot:</p>

		<p>This is the same engine built on the same contract as the <i>Red Cloud</i> and the <i>Maris Pearl</i>, but unlike those two it doesn't have the clear camshaft view ports on the starboard side.  Interesting.</p>

		<p>Thanks for the update and the photos, Jerry - I hope that I can make it to the <i>Sakarissa</i> when I'm down in Oregon next month.</p>

		<h2>Footage from the <i>Quail</i></h2>

		<p>Dirk and his friend were treated to a demonstration of the tugboat <a href="../atlas/quail.html"><i>Quail</i></a>'s <a href="../atlas/index.html">Atlas-Imperial</a> diesel.  Here's a video of starting her up:</p>

		<p>Thanks, Dirk!</p>

		<h2>What is &quot;original?&quot;</h2>

		<p>When you're taking care of engines for which spare parts haven't been manufactured for 50 years, things tend to get changed around a lot.  While I try to stick to the original manufactures' parts and process, I have had to stray sometimes.  If I can't keep the engine &quot;original&quot;, then the next most important thing is to document the changes that do happen.  I've been keeping track of the changes I've made, but I need to start making better records of the process.  I'm going to start a list of variances to the OEM (Original Engine Manufacturer) designs here and on the website.  Over time, I hope to document all of the changes I've made - and all of the changes that other people have made and told me about.</p>

		<p>Here's a few to start off with:</p>

		<p>On the <a href="../washington/arthur.html"><i>Arthur Foss</i></a>'s <a href="../washington/index.html">Washington</a>:</p>
		* the fuel pressure regulator is an Atlas-Imperial fuel pressure regulator<br>
		* numbers two through six cylinder heads are a newer style with two studs and a collar to hold the valve cages, instead of one big castellated nut around the cage<br>
		* the new set of tappet guides have a zerk fitting or 1/8-inch pipe tapped hole in each</p>

		<p>On the <a href="../washington/catalyst.html"><i>Catalyst</i></a>'s <a href="../washington/index.html">Washington</a>:</p>

		* the injector tips, while Washington-style on the outside, are Atlas-Imperial-style on the inside<br>
		* the fuel pressure regulator has an atlas imperial seat and stem - inferior to the reversible Washington design<br>
		* the new valves are one-piece (this is forgivable)<br>
		* the valve cages have new noses and are not one piece any more<br>
		* the guides are off the shelf (from MAN or something)<br>
		* the rod bearing nuts are nylock and not &quot;large profile&quot;<br>
		* the clutch guide pins are two piece<br>
		* the pneumatic shifting has been replaced with hydraulic</p>

		<p>On the <a href="../atlas/westward.html"><i>Westward</i></a>'s <a href="../atlas/index.html">Atlas-Imperial</a>:</p>
		* no Manzell</p>

		<p>On the <a href="../atlas/theafoss1.html"><i>Thea Foss</i></a>'s <a href="../atlas/index.html">Atlas-Imperials</a>:</p>

		<p>* much of the engine room controls have been replaced or altered to allow better remote operation</p>
		
		<p>On the <a href="../enterprise/brianamarin.html"><i>Briana Marin</i></a>'s <a href="../enterprise/index.html">Enterprise</a>:</p>

		<p>* the thrust bearing and carrying portion of the bed plate has been removed to make room for the gear</p>

		<p>That's it for now.  Mechanics, owners, enthusiasts: do you know of any other changes to any other heavy-duty boat?  Comment here and we'll start putting together this record.</p>

		<h2>Autumn Programs at Northwest Seaport</h2>

		<p>Old Tacoma Marine Inc has a very good relationship with the <a href="http://www.nwseaport.org"></a>Northwest Seaport and I try to help them out when I can.  I'm of course most interested in the programs involving the <a href="../washington/arthur.html"><i>Arthur Foss</i></a>.  I teach all the engine classes held aboard, and last year I not only directed (instigated) the Classic Workboat Show, but I was also the largest sponsor of time and money.  Autumn is planning season for Northwest Seaport, so I've gotten more involved again by helping them plan next year's programming and raise funds to make it all happen.</p>

		<p>As a start, I went the <a href="http://www.atlakeunionpark.org"></a>Lake Union Park Working Group meeting, held every other Friday.  All the groups with a stake at South Lake Union send representatives to discuss everything going on, from individual projects to giant joint programs.  A major item on the agenda this week was planning joint programs for 2009, but we ended up pushing that back to the next meeting to give all the groups a little more time to recover from the summer.  I'm going to meet with Northwest Seaport before that next meeting to commit to expanding the programming schedule just a little more, like we've done for the past few years.</p>

		<p>I have a few programs that I try to put on every year with the Seaport and the <a href="http://www.cwb.org">Center for Wooden Boats</a>: Engineer for a Day, Diesel Engine Theory, and the new Tugboat night.  These are each engine-centric, mostly on the <i>Arthur</i>, but Engineer for a Day uses all four boats on the wharf (I wrote about it way way back in <a href="2008week07.html"></a>February).  The biggest (and most expensive) single class is Diesel Engine Theory, which is our take-it-apart-and-fix-it class that we're using to restore the <i>Arthur</i>'s big Washington:</p>

		<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nwseaport/2069798368/in/set-72157603316318967"><img src="images/2008week39_2.jpg" border="0" alt="Diesel Engine Theory 2006 aboard the tugboat Arthur Foss"></a></p>

		<p>We're planning out next year's programs and finishing this year's, and finding (as usual) that the main need for each class is participants and funding.  For this year's Diesel Engine Theory class (the only remaining 2008 program), we've already got two or three people signed up, and Northwest Seaport is already a third of the way towards raising the total cost of the program (thanks to a <a href="http://4culture.org/heritage/funding/projects/2008_awards.htm">4Culture Special Projects grant</a>), but we really need to fill the class and get the other two-thirds of the money in hand before we start this year's work.</p>

		<p>Northwest Seaport's staff and board are very busy, so I usually take on a lot of the behind-the-scenes program management.  This includes advertising the class and fundraising, on top of the mechanic stuff I need to do to get ready (we really need to order rings soon).  This work is essential, since without the organizing, advertising, fundraising, and paper trail, we are spinning our wheels as opposed to building something solid and sustainable that transcends the boat itself.</p>

		<p>This gets back to one of my major philosophies.  To lift up a boat (or a maritime organization) you need something bigger than that boat (or maritime organization).  I think that the best &quot;something bigger&quot; is education.  Engine room education is important (the <a href="http://www.ymta.net">YMTA</a> can <a href="http://www.ymta.net/whyymta.asp">tell you why</a> better than I can) and the <i>Arthur Foss</i> just happens to be the best platform for this type of training.  She's a really neat boat, owned by a museum that's dedicated to keeping her around to teach the public about boats, and she's moored in the middle of Seattle.  The classes and programs we run aboard her for the benefit of the general public can lift the <i>Arthur Foss</i> up and make something more of her than just an old boat.</p>

		<p>Of course, last year a program literally lifted the <i>Arthur Foss</i> right out of the water:</p>

		<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nwseaport/2024372051/in/set-72157603180983529"></a><img src="images/2008week39_3.jpg" border="0" alt="the tugboat Arthur Foss in dry-dock, October 2007"></p>

		<p>That was a great feeling.</p>

		<p>Getting back to the upcoming Diesel Engine Theory course, we need behind-the-scenes funding to get it off the ground.  If you can help out, <a href="http://oldtacomamarine.wordpress.com/contact-old-tacoma-marine-inc/">contact me</a> now.</p>

		<p>The wish list as it stands for the upcoming <i>Arthur Foss</i> programming includes:</p>

		<p>* cash<br>
		* diesel fuel and lubricating oils<br>
		* program participants<br>
		* time on a dry dock<br>
		* (1) 18-to-one torque multiplier<br>
		* volunteers to do behind the scenes work (advertising, fundraising, setup, etc) - <a href="http://oldtacomamarine.wordpress.com/contact">sign up</a> for one or more positions now! </p>
