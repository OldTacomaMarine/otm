		<h1>2008 Week 42 in Review</h1><br>
		<h3>October 12 to October 18, 2008</h3><br><br>

<h2>A visit to the <i>Sakarissa</i></h2>

		<p>I finished my trip to Portland by visiting the <a href="../enterprise/sakarissa.html"><i>Sakarissa</i></a>, which is tied up in the Columbia River:</p>

		<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/oldtacomamarine/2938260789/in/set-72157607992791436"><img src="images/2008week42_1.jpg" border="0" alt="tugboat Sakarissa, powered by an Enterprise diesel engine"></a></p>

		<p>It's a World War II tug (YTM-269), powered by a DMQ 8 <a href="../enterprise/index.html">Enterprise</a> (serial number 41119).  It has a new governor, a new seawater pump, and a Sperry steering system (with a few problems).  Jerry gave us a great tour all throughout the boat.</p>

		<h2>Back to business</h2>

		<p>After I got back from Portland, I did some cleaning at the shop and found some interesting links to share. <a href="http://www.buysell.com/boating/articles/jan03/profiles_boggs.asp">Here's</a> an old but interesting article about my friend Rick Boggs (and yes, two of the photo captions are mixed up), and <a href="http://www.tugboatenthusiastsociety.org/index.htm">here's</a> the website for the Tugboat Enthusiasts Society.  Check out their article on <a href="http://www.tugboatenthusiastsociety.org/Pages/tugmach-diesel-ancient-ent-01.htm">Enterprise diesels</a>.</p>

		<p>I also got a long email from Doug Leen about his experience with Mercs.  He's also posted it to his blog, so you can read about it all <a href="http://www.dougleen.com/ontheroad/">here</a>.</p>

		<h2>Lead ballast for the <i>Catalyst</i></h2>

		<p>On Friday, I picked up about 2,000 pounds of lead to help ballast the <a href="../washington/catalyst.html">Catalyst</a> a little better.  I had to borrow Dan's truck to haul it up to Port Townsend in one load.</p>

		<p>While in Port Townsend, I stopped by Sirens for a drink with Crystal.  We ran into Lee Ehrheart, the marine surveyor who works on the Adventuress and other local historic ships.  I guess it's hard to go to PT without running into boat people.</p>

		<h2>The <i><i>Duwamish</i></i>... Finished?!?</h2>

		<p>I finally finished the work on the fireboat <i><i>Duwamish</i>'s a</i>ir compressor and got it all put back together.  I was planning on test-running it, but I had to transfer fuel by hand and ran out of time for the day.  I'll run it for a while next week and see what kind of pressure we can get out of it now.</p>

		<h2>A visit to Seattle's sewage pumps</h2>

		<p>Nick took me on a tour of the sewer pump facility in Interbay, where all of downtown Seattle's waste water and rain water is pumped out to the treatment plant.  They use three big 48-inch pumps, one electric, one Waukesha natural gas engine, and one Chicago Pneumatic natural gas engine:</p>

		<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/oldtacomamarine/3005860661/"><img src="images/2008week42_2.jpg" border="0" alt="Chicago Pneumatic diesel generator powering some of Seattle's municipal sewage pumps"></a></p>

		<p>The city's planning to replace them all with electric motors, with a diesel generator on standby. Nick loves the old diesels and wanted to show off the Chicago Pneumatic a bit before it goes.</p>

		<h2>Community dinner</h2>

		<p>Everywhere I go, I run in to folks who are connected to heavy-duty diesel engines.</p>

		<p>On Thursday Lia (naturalist on the <i><a href="../washington/catalyst.html"><i>Catalyst</i></a>)</i> and I (relief engineer on the <i><i>Catalyst</i></i>) attended one of the <a href="http://www.chefannecatherine.com">communal dinners</a> that Chef Anne Catherine (cook on the <i><i>Catalyst</i></i>) holds.   We arrived, and there were Eric (former engineer on the <i><i>Catalyst</i></i>) and Laura (with Eric, owner of the <a href="../atlas/index.html">Atlas-Imperial</a>-powered <i><a href="../atlas/newt.html"><i>Newt</i></a>)</i>.  We were joined a little later joined by Hugh and Teresa (owners of the Atlas-powered <i><a href="../atlas/westward.html"><i>Westward</i></a></i>).</p>

		<p>We all sat with fifteen others for an amazing dinner of fresh, local ingredients prepared by Chef Anne Catherine, who told about how each had been acquired from a local farmers' market.  After dinner, we went for a nightcap at the Ballard Smoke Shop and ran into Harry (engineer on the Atlas-powered <i><a href="../atlas/veleroiv.html"><i>Velero IV</i></a></i>).</p>

		<p>Small world.</p>
