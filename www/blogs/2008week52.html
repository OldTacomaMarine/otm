		<h1>2008 Week 52 in Review</h1><br>
		<h3>December 21 to December 27, 2008</h3><br><br>

		<h2>Work continues on the <i>Catalyst</i></h2>

		<p>This week, I finally finished up filing and sanding and polishing the <a href="../washington/catalyst.html"><i>Catalyst</i></a>'s crankshaft journals.  I also continued fitting the main bearings in using plastigauges.  The project is coming along nicely.</p>

		<h2>Ever expanding the web presence</h2>

		<p>To better serve you, dear readers, I joined the <a href="http://www.mediabloggers.org"></a>Media Bloggers Association and took one of their online media blogger law class to further educate myself about this medium.</p>

		<p>I also signed up for a <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> account, under the username  <a href="http://www.twitter.com/oldtacomamarine/">oldtacomamarine</a>.  Now, you'll be able to keep up with my on-the-go status reports even easier.</p>

		<h2>Annual board meeting</h2>

		<p>Every year on December 25th, Old Tacoma Marine Inc's board of directors and share holders meet to elect officers, review the past year's activities, look at the budget, and forecast the next year.  The president also buys a round or two of drinks for the shareholders to get into the spirit of things.</p>

		<p>Topics on this year's agenda included:<br>
		* continuing to balance jobs between commercial, pleasure, and museum boats and engines, but in the up-coming year increase customers in the collecting sector up to 10% of the annual gross.<br>
		* hiring Diana the museum specialist as a part-time employee, instead of continuing a contractual arrangement for technical writing, interpretation, and online presentation<br>
		* continue to expand the company's web presence and weekly blogging</p>

		<p>These were all great things to report and reflect on during the yearly meeting.  Unfortunately, the final topic was to announce that the president (me) will receive a pay cut - but there will be occasional bonuses.</p>

		<p>All in all, it's been a good year.  We'll release the annual report and 2009 objectives very soon.</p>
