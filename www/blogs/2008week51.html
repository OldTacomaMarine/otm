		<h1>2008 Week 51 in Review</h1><br>
		<h3>December 14 to December 20, 2008</h3><br><br>

		<h2>Work continues on the <i>Catalyst</i></h2>

		<p>This week, I kept filing and sanding and polishing the crankshaft journals to fit the newly-poured bearings.  I am very thankful that this is almost done. </p>

		<p>I also installed the main bearings in the engine.  Since we had them machined to be thicker on the sides, they were a little hard to roll in, but we got them in anyway.  Once they were in, I used plastigauges (remember <a href="2008week45.html">Week 45</a>) to measure the clearance.  We're shooting for four to five thousands of an inch clearance on the main bearings.  </p>

		<h2>On the automotive bail-out</h2>

		<p>This week, Old Tacoma Marine inc. chose not to send the CEO in his jet to beg the United States government for a bail-out, because to do so would completely undermine the survival of the fittest in the free market <i>and</i> promote poor products and inefficient operations.  Though such a trip would most likely have gained OTM Inc a few billion dollars (the way they're giving it away these days), we decided to make it on our own.</p>
