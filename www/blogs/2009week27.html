		<h1>2009 Week 27 in Review</h1><br>
		<h3>June 28 to July 5, 2009</h3><br><br>

		<h2>Work continues on the <i>Arthur Foss</i></h2>

		<p>This week, we put the <a href="../washington/arthur.html"><i>Arthur Foss</i></a> all back together.  All the parts are cleaned and many painted, the head is down, the piston is in, and the rod bearing is in, and I tightened everything down and painted the cylinder and deck plates just in time for class on Saturday.  But first:</p>

		<h2>More Enterprises</h2>

		<p>Doug reminded us via email to include the Alaska Ferries <i>Malaspina</i> and <i>Columbia</i> to the list of <a href="../enterprise/specs.html">Enterprise-powered</a> boats.  Will do, Doug - does anyone know what model they are?  The <a href="../enterprise/goldenbear1.html"><i>Golden Bear</i></a> is powered by two big <a href="../enterprise/specs.html">R5-V16</a> diesels - do the ferries have that same model?</p>

		<h2>New owners for the <i>Kaluah Maru</i>?</h2>

		<p>I've heard a rumor that the <i>Kaluah Maru</i>, a boat in Hawaii with two Superiors, has new owners.  Anyone hear anything concrete?  OTM Inc is investigating.</p>

		<h2>The <i>Dunlin</i> moves to Seattle</h2>

		<p>I got an email from Keith in which he said that the <a href="../atlas/dunlin.html"><i>Dunlin</i></a> has moved to Seattle.  I can't wait to meet the new owner and see the boat!</p>

		<h2>Diesel Engine Theory Session Five!</h2>

		<p>With all the parts ready and all the tools laid out, the class attacked the engine early Saturday morning.  We wanted to get a good start on the work left - bumping the bearings, timing the valves and injectors, and getting it ready to run -since Saturday also started the 34th Annual Lake Union Wooden Boat Festival!  Since 2005, OTM Inc has been a part of the show by running the <i>Arthur</i>'s engine throughout the festival as a demonstration.  The public <i>loves</i> it, and this year the students were going to help us keep it going.</p>

		<p>While the engineers were in the engine room, chef Kim was in the smoking hot galley.  She baked bread all morning, turning the galley into a roasting pit of despair, but the bread was very tasty.  Here's the instructions and recipe, tailored for baking on the <i>Arthur Foss</i>:</p>

		<p>At 7 or 8 am, turn on the stove; first, remove the firebox cover and vacuum or scrape the bits of carbon out of the firebox and the diesel cup.  Next, open the valve from the day tank, open the valve to the meter, open the valve on the meter, and turn the meter up to full.  Look down into the firebox; when you see a little diesel trickle out of the hole, light it with the blow torch that's kept in the galley drawer.  You'll probably have to fire it for a while with the torch to get it alight.</p>

		<p>Once it's on, let it get hot and smoky and fiery, then turn on the fan.  Open the fan damper until it doesn't smoke any more - but not too much, or the fire will start to flicker like a strobe.  Adjust it until you find the happy medium between strobe and smoke, and continue to check it for the next several hours.</p>

		<p>Have some coffee, run the generator, clean the counter, have some more coffee.  At 10 or 11, when stove is nearing 300°, dissolve <b>2tsp yeast</b> in <b>2 cups warm water</b>, then add:</p>

		<p><b>5-1/2 cups flour<br>
		3/4 cup sugar<br>
		1 to 2 tsp salt</b></p>

		<p><i>Mix</i>, not knead, all this together and fold dough into a rounded lump. Cover lightly with cloth and put in a warm, not hot, place.  The dish rack over the sink is perfect, and keeps it out of the way.  Let rise to double its size.</p>

		<p>Divide dough in half, form into two lumps, and place in the big glass pan.  Cover lightly and let rise to double its size and the oven is between 350° and 400°.</p>

		<p>Place in center of oven and bake 10-15 min, or until top is VERY golden brown. Remove the bread from the oven, wait <strong>no more</strong> and <strong>no less</strong> than five minutes before removing from pan.  Eat it hot with butter.</p>

		<p>The original recipe is featured in Lin Pardey's awesome seacook's book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Care-Feeding-Sailing-Crew/dp/1929214073/"><i>The Care and Feeding of the Offshore Crew</i></a>.  Kim sliced most of this loaf and left it out on the counter with butter, and it was gone within an hour.</p>

		<p>Back to the engine.  We had everything buttoned up by one and we all held our breaths as we blew down the engine, then started it up.  It started right up - but the new head gasket didn't fully seat and a little air hissed out between the head and the cylinder on every compression stroke.  We shut it down quick because it was making sounds like a dying goose.</p>

		<p>After we cleaned up, the students had the next two hours to check out the Wooden Boat Festival and all the great old boats at South Lake Union for the weekend.  Sadly, no other boats with heavy-duty diesels came, but it was still a great show.  Meanwhile, tons of kids mobbed the boat for Pirate Story Hour:</p>

		<p>At four, we all headed over to <a href="http://www.bucadibeppo.com/locations/default.aspx?location=4701">Buca di Beppo</a> for a very tasty celebration dinner.</p>

		<p>At six, the show closed and the class ended.  Everyone filled out course evaluations at the restaurant, and they gave us rave reviews.  Here's a sample:</p>

		<p><i>I think the program was coo.  I really liked it and learned a lot.  It would be better if we had a couple of days in the week instead of one.  MoB MoB MoB L*fe L*fe L*fe."</i></p>

		<p>We think that's a complement.</p>

		<p>I know that <i>I</i> had a good time this session.  It's too bad that the head gasket didn't fully seat, but it wasn't anyone's fault; the engine is old and sometimes these things happen.  Despite not running the engine all afternoon Saturday, I would still say that this was one of the best classes and we addressed many issues with the engine, so the class was definitely a success.</p>

		<p>Next year, we'll do Cylinder One.</p>
