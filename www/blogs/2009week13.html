		<h1>2009 Week 13 in Review</h1><br>
		<h3>March 22 to March 28, 2009</h3><br><br>

		<h2>More work on the <i>Maris Pearl</i></h2>

		<p>This week, OTM Inc started work on the <a href="../enterprise/marispearl.html"><i>Maris Pearl</i></a>'s bilge system.  Not too much to report there.</p>

		<h2>Update on the Lightship #83</h2>

		<p><a href="http://www.nwseaport.org">Northwest Seaport</a> is getting ready to start the big deck replacement project on the Lightship #83, and they asked OTM Inc to research and compile a list of basic essential tools to stock  the boat.</p>

		<p>Last year's Preliminary Engineering Assessment budgeted $3K for this step, which will buy a good selection of wrenches, screw-drivers, scrapers, and other essential hand tools to keep aboard for general work.  Specialists and contractors working on the boat will bring their own tools along, but it's important to have a full set to stay aboard.</p>

		<h2>Updates on the OTM Inc website</h2>

		<p>Check out the re-networked <a href="../index.shtml">Old Tacoma Marine Inc website</a>!  We consolidated all of our social networking clients at the bottom of the main page, so now you can follow OTM all over the web.</p>

		<p>Stay tuned for more exciting changes to the front page!</p>

		<h2>The <i>Ready</i> Sold!</h2>

		<p>The tug <a href="../atlas/ready.html"><i>Ready</i></a> is a 65 foot ST tug from 1945 powered by a <a href="../atlas/specs.html">6HM2124 Atlas-Imperial</a> diesel engine.  It's been sitting for a long time in Long Beach, California, unused (its former owner was aware of the liability involved in running it).</p>

		<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oldtacomamarine/3507397669/"><img src="images/2009week13_1.jpg" border="0" alt="Atlas-Imperial Diesel Engine in the tug Ready, at Old Tacoma Marine Inc" /></a></p>

		<p>Last year, the boat was given to local wharfrat Steffen, who parted out or scrapped all the electronics and brass, then sold what was left on eBay.  Proud new owners Carla's and Tim are powering their way through the steep learning curve of old tugboat ownership as they prepare the boat for a trip up to San Francisco Bay.</p>

		<p>Tim has read through the <a href="../atlas/index.html">Atlas-Imperial</a> manual on the OTM website (view it yourself <a href="../atlas/manual.html">here</a>), and has been working with John, our trusted OTM representative, to make enough repairs to run the engine for a short time.</p>

		<p>It is very exciting to add another engine to the list of the living.  It sounds like I'll be heading down there soon, so stay tuned!</p>
