		<h1>2009 Week 16 in Review</h1><br>
		<h3>April 12 to April 18, 2009</h3><br><br>

		<p>This week, I replaced the batteries on the <a href="../enterprise/marispearl.html"><i>Maris Pearl</i></a>.  They are really heavy, and so OTM Inc had its first insurance claim this year.  I chipped two of my teeth while we were pushing the heavy cart up the gang way - the handle smacked right into my mouth.  I look like Alfred E. Neuman.</p>

		<h2>Assessing the <i>Ready</i></h2>

		<p>Later this week, I went to Long Beach to check out the <a href="../atlas/ready.html"><i>Ready</i></a>, the old tug that sold a few weeks back.  New owner Tim wanted to better understand the condition of the engine, hopped down to California for an overnight trip.</p>

		<p>We ran the engine for a while, diagnosed a few problems, and discussed the long-term maintenance needs.  We had one cylinder not firing and I chose that one for the valve-and-injector drill.  I pulled the valves and injectors out, cleaned all the parts, and found the injector was plugged.  I put it all back together and stuck it back in, but it still didn't work.</p>

		<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oldtacomamarine/3481563900/"><img src="images/2009week16_1.jpg" border="0" alt="testing injectors on the tug Ready"></a></p>

		<p>At that point, away from my shop and with the clock ticking, all I could do was suggest that Tim send the injector up to Seattle for an overhaul (or a core credit towards a new one, if the old one was irreparable).  I also told him that all injectors will need the same treatment soon.</p>

		<p>It was a good trip, though, because I'm excited to see the boat get some much-needed attention.  I can't wait for the next trip!</p>

		<h2>Still waiting for Illinois</h2>

		<p>The folks in Illinois still haven't set a date for me to come out to work on their <a href="../fairbanks/index.html">Fairbanks-Morse</a> bearings, but I started getting ready anyway.  I picked up some Timesaver lapping compound, sharpened my scrapers, bought some new files... that kind of thing.  Hopefully, I'll be making the trip next week.</p>

		<h2>Shop pranks</h2>

		<p>While I was out, some jerk (Dan) put wood plugs in the candy machine at the shop.  What a jerk.</p>

		<h2>Praise for Engineer for a Day</h2>

		<p>I met with John Foster who had many evaluations from the high school class that took the engineer for a day class a few months ago.  Overall, the kids thought it was a great class but they overwhelmingly agreed that without live steam the <i>Virginia V</i> portion of the class was lame.  So we applied for a grant from <a href="http://www.4culture.org">4Culture</a> to do just that.</p>
