		<h2>Still scraping bearings</h2>

		<p>OTM Inc spent most of this week scraping and fitting rod bearings for the <a href="../fairbanks/indiangrave1.html">Indian Grave Drainage Pumphouse</a>'s <a href="../fairbanks/index.html">Fairbanks-Morse</a> diesels, and making some fine adjustments to the main bearings.  I did this with much relief, after getting satisfactory results when testing the main bearings.</p>

		<h2>Report on the MV <i>Tuhoe</i></h2>

		<p>Old Tacoma Marine Inc's intrepid investigative reporter Jacoba took a field trip to see the <a href="../atlas/index.html">Atlas</a> boat <a href="../atlas/tuhoe1.html"><i>MV Tuhoe</i></a> in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=105103426574378662388.00043ae6dce7a83e0fcc6&amp;ll=-43.384872,172.664566&amp;spn=0.013442,0.027637&amp;t=h&amp;z=15">Kaiapoi</a>, New Zealand.  This neat old boat (the only Atlas boat we know of in the Southern Hemisphere) is an old cargo auxiliary schooner, powered by twin 6EM327 Atlas-Imperial diesel engines.</p>

		<p>Interestingly, the association that owns her (the MV Tuhoi Preservation Society) has a <i>third</i> identical engine that they use for parts.  It sounds like they've put a lot of love into the boat and they have a lot of community support.  Jacoba wrote up a great article about the boat that talks more about that:</p>

		<p><i>The twin Atlas-Imperial engines of the M.V. Tuhoe rattle in well-tuned percussion as John Thompson, one of the ship's chief engineers, eases on the throttle. The engine room is tidy, and the fixtures are color-coded with bright, glossy layers of paint to help newly-trained volunteers. </i></p>

		<h2><i>Arthur Foss</i> Cylinder Four Overhaul begins!</h2>

		<p>I flew back to Seattle on Thursday night, just in time for the Diesel Engine Theory workshop on the <a href="../washington/arthur.html"><i>Arthur Foss</i></a>.  OTM Inc runs this in partnership with <a href="http://www.nwseaport.org/">Northwest Seaport</a> and the <a href="http://www.cwb.org">Center for Wooden Boats</a> at South Lake Union.  We've been planning this session - overhauling cylinder four - for years, and getting ready for the class was stressful since I was in Illinois most of the month.  I really wanted everything to go well despite only preparing over the phone, but I shouldn't have worried too much.</p>

		<p>The first session went very well.  We had eight participants (a full boat!), including four guys from <a href="http://www.theanchorprogram.com/">The Anchor Program</a> (known as TAP) who've been doing a bunch of work on the <i>Arthur</i>.  After coffee and introductions, we took a tour of the boat, oiled and greased everything, and ran the engine and both generators for a while. I got a lot of good questions and everyone was really interested in the boat and the engine and diesel engines in general.</p>

		<p>Part of any workshop we do with Northwest Seaport is the Galley Program, where we use the boat's galley and especially the diesel stove to make lunches for everyone.  Chef Lia prepared the best and possibly the most tacos ever cooked in the <i>Arthur</i>'s muy caliantá galley:</p>

		<p>After lunch, Dan gave his Diesel Engine Theory lecture, which was even better than last time.  He brought along a lot of parts to illustrate his points, along with dire warnings to not damage the injector tips!</p>

		<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nwseaport/3659801621/in/set-72157620237562868/"><img src="images/2009week23_4.jpg" border="0" alt="Crystal examines an injector tip"></a></p>

		<p>After the lecture, it was time for the big moment: taking the engine apart and fixing it. I'd gone and gotten a lot of tools while preparing for the class, so I divided the students into two groups.  I set one group to taking all the jewelry off the head, and the other group to taking the access panels off the bottom of the engine and getting ready to take the rod off the crankshaft.</p>

		<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nwseaport/3660553331/in/set-72157620237562868/"><img src="images/2009week23_5.jpg" border="0" alt="George takes apart the cooling system"></a></p>

		<p>Now, I bet a bunch of you reading this are thinking &quot;holy cow, he just let a bunch of students start taking stuff apart and he wasn't watching them like a vulture watches a dying horse?&quot;  Well, heavy-duties like the <i>Arthur</i>'s Washington come all apart pretty easily with socket wrenches and screwdrivers, but there's a <i>lot</i> of hardware that has to be taken off.  All the students were really doing was turning wrenches, but if you've never taken apart an engine before, you learn tons from just turning the wrench and seeing how it's all put together.</p>

		<p>By the end of the day, we had cylinder four nearly all stripped down.  We got stuck on one head nut just as five o' clock rolled around, so we left it like that for the night.  I'll have a lot more to report about the class next week, so stay tuned!</p>
