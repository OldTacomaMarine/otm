		<h1>About Old Tacoma Marine Inc.</h1>
		<p>Old Tacoma Marine Inc. was founded January 1, 2000 to repair, service, maintain, operate, and advocate for the preservation of antique, large-bore, slow-speed diesel engines built before 1955 -- especially those manufactured by the Atlas-Imperial, Washington Iron Works, Enterprise Foundry, and Fairbanks-Morse companies.</p>
		<p>The company incorporated in 2005 and is headquartered in Seattle, Washington, in the historic Ballard neighborhood.  Current clients range from charter boat operators and owners, to private sportsmen with luxurious tugboat yachts, to working research and fishing vessels, to museum vessels preserved in perpetuity for public benefit.
