		<h1>Washington Iron Works</h1>
		<br>
		
		<p>Washington Iron Works was a Seattle-based manufacturing company that built machinery for the Northwest's logging industry. In the 1920s, WIW partnered with mechanical engineer Adrian Estep to begin producing a line of diesel engines that powered logging equipment and a variety of local workboats. From 1921 to 1951, Washington Iron Works built more than 600 diesel engines, which developed a reputation as being reliable and easy to service.</p>
