		<h1>Fairbanks-Morse Diesel Engines</h1>
		<p>The Fairbanks-Morse company was a major manufacturer of heavy-duty engines starting with the Model Y semi-diesel in 1913.  The company further expanded into full diesels in in 1924, producing heavy-duty in-line engines that powered medium-sized boats and served as stationary on-land generators.</p>
		<p>Fairbanks-Morse manufactured a wide range of other industrial equipment, starting with platform scales and waterpumps and a wide variety of gasoline engines, locomotive engines, and the widely-known opposed-piston engines used in submarines.  Their heavy-duty diesel line halted in the 1950s as high-speed diesel engines began to dominate the market.  Fairbanks-Morse continues to manufacture high-speed diesel engines and other industrial equipment to this day. </p>
